Purchase_Request:
=================


This module is intended for Odoo V8. It is a partial port of ac_purch_request
 from Almacom (Thailand) Inc. The original module (by Almacom) was written for
 a version prior to V7. Not all functionality of the original will be ported
 to this version.


* The Purchase Request module allows interal demand to be created (by employees) 
for material/parts to be ordered.

* Multiple (line) items can be added to a purchase request. The purchasing
 officer can convert the items to a PO.

* Stay tuned for the Purchase_Request_Analytic_Accounts module, which will
 allow specific Analytic Accounts to be identified and charged against for
 various line items.
